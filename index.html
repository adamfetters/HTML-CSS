    Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I am continuing to improve on my skills, and as I do so, this page will change. Below
    you will find information on myself, including a short bio, projects I have done, and ways to contact me. I am looking
    forward to being part of your team. Let's see what we can build together.

    <p class="about__description">
      My name is Adam Fetters and i'm obsessed with technology. Ever since I was 3 and my parents bought me a Tandy 1000, I would
      play all the time. (You remember the one with the cartridges, attached keyboard, and a little joystick that had 2 buttons,
      if you were lucky). I attended DeVry University on a partial academic scholorship in 1999 with a major in Electronics
      Engineering Technology. After a year I had a 4.0, but I dropped out after getting a great job, as I wasn't mature enough
      to realize the value of education. I ended up living in Columbus, Ohio for 5 years, where I got experience in marketing,
      sales, I.T., and even worked at a gym for a little while. Great for me, as I loved to workout. I found my way back
      into college at a later time in my life where I graduated with a degree in Audio Engineering / Video Production. I
      shot some commericals, worked on a few short films, low budget projects, but never really got going in that industry.
      I always dabbled in coding, html, css, but never really knew which direction to go or was fully invested. After years
      of doing manual labor including masonry, factory, painting, along with playing poker on the side, I decided to get
      back into programming and joined a bootcamp in Memphis, Tennessee. It was fast paced, and I struggled with the JavaScript
      aspect, and ended up moving back home. I continued building on that education, and after a few months started to get
      the hang of javascript. After googling "Get paid to code", I stumbled upon Lambda School, where I know am in my 3rd
      week and loving it! I have learned more in this time, than my whole life, and have finally figured out what makes me
      wake up every morning. Coding!
